You have been chosen to be a part of a select few, who have permission to use the glider tubes for the purpose of maintenance and transportation. I will now be giving you a quick reminder about the safety checklist, which must be followed at all times: Do not turn on the Glider whilst outside of water. Do not drop the Glider. Do not let go of the handlebar whilst in operation. Do not ram the Glider into walls, or other stationary objects. Do not use the Glider to purposefully commit roadkill. Do not take the Glider on joyrides. Do not take the Glider through the de-synchronization tunnels without clearance or further training. Should any of these safety procedures be broken depending on the severity, will result in either a pay-dock, contractual termination, or execution. If you wish for a reminder, ask a designated Glider station operator. Swim safely!" },

You may jump off walls with the same speed as a ground-based jump, enabling continuous movement from wall to wall, or from wall to platform." },
